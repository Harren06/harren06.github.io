            Github is a place where people store code projects. It's used for open source development because people can collaborate on projects, or take an existing project and adapt it. Github relies on git, a version control software (version control = keeping track of changes to files), but you don't have to worry about that yet - just know that git and github are different things. Also, while Github is great for code, <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/11/08/seven-ways-to-use-github-that-arent-coding" target="blank">it's not only for developers</a>!

            Fork my repo, <a href="https://github.com/cathydeng/simple-website-template" target="blank">simple-website-template</a>
          </p>
          <p class="step-detail">
            A <i>repo</i> or <i>repository</i> is just another word for project, & <i>fork</i> is just another word for copy. The <a href="https://github.com/cathydeng/simple-website-template" target="blank">cathydeng/simple-website-template</a> repo is the code for this website. To fork a repo, click the fork button on the top right.
          </p>
          <p class="step-detail">
            A few things happen when you fork simple-website-template:
          </p>
          <ul class="step-detail">
            <li>
              <strong>You get a copy of the code</strong> - a simple-website-template repo under <i>your</i> github account<br>
              <i class="fa fa-link"></i> https://github.com/[YOUR USERNAME]/simple-website-template
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>You get a copy of this website</strong> - at <i>your own url</i>, yay!<br>
              <i class="fa fa-link"></i> https://[YOUR USERNAME].github.io/simple-website-template
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="well well-sm step-detail">
            You have your own url because github has a really nifty feature, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>, which hosts static pages for you. If you're curious, here are some notes on how this works:
            <small>
            <ul>
              <li>For any github repo, if you have code in the <code>gh-pages</code> branch, github will look for whatever is in <code>index.html</code> & host it at https://[YOUR USERNAME].github.io/[YOUR REPO NAME]</li>
              <li>You can see what branches a repo has by clicking the branch dropdown on a repo page. Think of branches as different versions of the files within your repo, kind of like 'save as' on a repo (yes, git-related words are weird).</li>
              <li>When you create a repo from scratch, you start with one default branch called <code>master</code>, and you'll have to create the <code>gh-pages</code> branch. Within a repo, you can create however many branches you want.</li>
              <li>Because there's already a <code>gh-pages</code> branch in <a href="https://github.com/cathydeng/simple-website-template" target="blank">cathydeng/simple-website-template</a>, all forks of the repo will also have a <code>gh-pages</code> branch</li>
            </ul></small>

            Tweak stuff to your heart's content
          </p>
          <p class="step-detail"><strong>HOW TO EDIT FILES</strong></p>
          <p class="step-detail">
            Within your simple-website-template repo on github (https://github.com/[YOUR USERNAME]/simple-website-template), you'll see <code>index.html</code>, a folder called <code>css/</code> with <code>custom.css</code> inside it, and <code>README.md</code> (whenever a repo has a README.md inside it, github displays it on the repo page below the file list). You can click the files to see their contents, and click the <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> icon to edit your code, in your browser!
          </p>
          <p class="step-detail"><strong>HOW TO 'SAVE' YOUR CHANGES</strong></p>
          <p class="step-detail">
            When you're happy with what you have, you'll need to commit your changes. Think of committing as saving. Each time you make a commit on github, you can put a message saying what you did - in the future, you can see each of your commits, and how your files changed (version control! yay). When you commit, see step 4!
          </p>
          <p class="step-detail"><strong>PREVIEWING YOUR CHANGES</strong></p>
          <p class="step-detail">
            You'll probably want to see what your website will look like, without blindly tweaking html/css - after all, coding is mostly an exercise in trial & error. This is where codepen comes in - coding in a browser! You can <a href="http://codepen.io/pen/" target="blank">create a new 'pen'</a>, copy over your html & css, and see the result. Try deleting everything within the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag in the html and making something completely new?
          </p>

            See the changes on your website! Instant gratification!
